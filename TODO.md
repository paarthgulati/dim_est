# TO-DO:

## Short-term:

1. (PG) Fix device handling. Currently works with cuda. Add proper device handling based on available platforms. Fix environment/requirements file accordingly.

2. (PG) Build Dataset classes and functions to import data instead of self-generated Datasets, with corresponding dataset dictionaries. Allow for image, neural and other arbitrary inputs

## Long-term:
